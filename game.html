		<div class="game_goal">
			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>In the course design evaluation at Simon Fraser University, the affective evaluation project was to evaluate four people’s subjective emotional and affective experiences to the video game "The Binding of Isaac." The team consisted of Eloise Choy, Kingsley Lp and I. It was a three-week project that required think-aloud interviews, data analyzing, and writing a detailed report.</p>

		<div class="game_solution">
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>We recruited four users that included friends and other students at Simon Fraser University who would be: comfortable being recorded, playing games, complete worksheets and answering questions. We decided to use a team room at SFU Surrey Library because it's quiet, the room is located in an isolated spot and the campus is a familiar environment. The research method that we used was an interview method since we could record the users and then build discussions off of the results.</p>

		<div class="game_user_process">
			<h3>User Process</h3>
			<p>We decided to use this order because we wanted the users to experience the game and get comfortable before asking any questions and to keep the results consistent we had all the users follow this particular order.</p>

			<ul>
			  <li>The users are playing the game for approximately 15 minutes
			  <ul>
			  	<li>The game and their expressions are being recorded</li>
			  	<li>We would ask them to tell us their strategies and feelings</li>
			  </ul>
			  </li>
			  
			  <li>Debrief session
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Users would walk us through the process and explain everything: why they did what, how they felt and anything they came to mind.</li>
			  </ul>
			  </li>

			  <li>User completes the IMI sheet
			  <ul>
				<li>Provides data on interest in the game, perceived competence, perceived choice and pressure</li>
			  </ul>
			  </li>
			</ul> 
		</div>

		<div class="game_team_process">
			<h3>Team Process</h3>

			<ol type="1">
				  <li>Each member transcribed a recording
				  	<ol>
				  		<li>the data from the recording needs to analyzed for the next part</li>
				  	</ol>
				  </li>

				<li>2 team member analyze each users data and group into positive, negative and neutral statements and or reactions
				  <ol>
				  	<li>2 teammates evaluate the data to make sure that both are on the same understanding.</li>
				  </ol>
				</li>

				<li>The inter-rated data for correlation report was completed to find the r (reliable) value
				  <ol>
				  	<li>if the r-value was not 0.8 or higher, both evaluators would have to redo the IMI sheet.</li>
				  </ol>
				</li>				

				<li>Once the r-value was considered reliable the reporting process could be written.</li>	

			</ol>

		<div class="game_research">
			<h3>Research Insights</h3>
			<p>User one felt that she did not fully understand the game but still enjoyed it. Felt pressure and stress while playing the game but was relieved when defeating enemies. 
			<br><br>
			User two was fairly positive playing the game but did not enjoy the vague instruction on how to use the weapons. Since it was a learning experience, after a few tries he felt a sense of accomplishment. 
			<br><br>
			User three did not enjoy the game at all because she did not understand the game mechanics and frequently died. She did learn some tactics which lead her to fight in the ‘boss battles.’
			<br><br>
			User four understood and played the game very well. Good positive feedback was given since he enjoyed fighting against the different type of ‘bosses.’
			<br><br>
			The project provided good information about The Binding of Isaac was not a perfect game. The users complained about visual feedback such as when picking up items and the UI of the game because it was confusing (in gamer terms "game-breaking").

		<div class="game_reflection">
			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>The Binding of Isaac was created with a small budget and had its flaws and inconsistencies. The game had many issues which I helped discover during our research phase; this included instruction on how to play the game and the confusing UI. I discovered that the users who felt comfortable and appreciated put in more effort to help us with the project. The biggest lesson that I learned was that I needed to be prepared for anything, such as questions, human errors like a camera dying and the mood of the environment. Users 2-4, the whole process was much smoother since I had taken the necessary steps to make sure the same mistake would not happen again. (Due to SFU policy and based on the consent form, I cannot provide the data that was collected.)</p>
